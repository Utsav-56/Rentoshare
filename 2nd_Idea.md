## 1. Background & Problem Statement

In today‚Äôs academic landscape, students from various universities, faculties, and class levels often struggle with finding the right study materials tailored to their syllabus and institution. There is no centralized platform where:

- Students can **share handwritten notes, solved papers, or lab reports** easily with peers.
- Learners from other colleges or years can **access verified, categorized, and relevant materials**.
- A **community-driven** academic ecosystem thrives ‚Äî one where _collaboration_ outweighs _competition_.

Students often:

- Waste hours searching across random forums, social platforms, and drives for proper resources.
- Lack access to institution-specific materials (like university-specific past papers or syllabus-based solutions).
- Miss out on collaborative learning opportunities due to fragmentation of resources.

> üí° **This platform solves** not just the problem of resource scarcity, but also bridges gaps between universities, classes, and students across regions.

## 2. Objective

To create a **collaborative, user-driven** web platform where **students and teachers can upload and access study resources** in any form ‚Äî notes, solutions, lab reports, assignments, exam prep materials ‚Äî categorized and searchable across classes, faculties, universities, and subjects.
